# Starknet Contracts Documentation

This README file provides documentation for the Starknet contracts in this project. It includes setup instructions and usage examples to help you get started with deploying and interacting with the Starknet contracts.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, including the Starknet CLI and Cairo 1.0. Follow the official Starknet documentation for installation instructions.

2. **Compile the Cairo Contract**: Navigate to the `src/contracts/starknet/contracts` directory and run the following command to compile the Cairo contract:

   ```
   starknet-compile my_contract.cairo
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract**: Use the Starknet CLI to deploy the compiled contract to the Starknet testnet. Make sure you have your wallet set up and funded with test ETH.

   ```
   starknet deploy --contract my_contract.json
   ```

4. **Interact with the Contract**: After deployment, you can interact with the contract using the Starknet CLI or by integrating it into your application.

## Usage Examples

- **Calling Functions**: You can call functions of the deployed contract using the Starknet CLI or through your application code.
